  <h4>This is a great song to listen to when you want to escape from the world. It says, "So wake me up when it's all over when I'm wiser and I'm older" this song made me realize two things.

The second thing is that you can't escape from your problems no matter how hard you try. You have to (wo)man up and deal with it.</h4>
