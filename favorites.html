  <h2>My jams!</h2>
  <h3> My jams are a collection of my favorite songs. These are the songs that hit me close to home and made me feel something. </h4>

<h4> Magics in the Hamptons BY: Social House [Feat. Lil Yachty] ALBUM: Magic in the Hamptons RELEASED: 2018 </h4>
<h4>My friends introduced “Magic in the Hamptons” to me, impressed that I’d never heard it before; they had told me that, “It just had my vibes.” After being intrigued by what this meant, they played the song and I fell in love. I have listened to this song numerous times on end and have gotten many of my friends hooked. It is a song that I felt like I knew, even though I had never heard it before. It gives me a form of nostalgia that comforts me and makes me feel at home. </h4>

The second thing is that you can't escape from your problems no matter how hard you try. You have to (wo)man up and deal with it.</h4>
