  <h2>About me</h2>
  <h3>My name is Rhea Pandya. I wrote this website to organize my love of music. I have so many songs swimming in my brain that I jot down on an imaginary notepad and store it in some random corner of my brain. I would find myself rediscovering songs that I already knew existed. So over the summer of twenty nineteen I made a list of songs. I first started out with a theme and went from there, I have now created a playlist called “<li><a href="https://music.amazon.com/my/playlists/happy/00edd83e-e14f-4e0e-8658-d70d89af2284">happy</a>” with over one hundred songs. The common theme between these songs is the happiness that they give me or the feeling of love and comfort I get. At first, this website wasn’t public because I didn’t feel the need for it. But over time I have felt selfish for keeping my love of music to myself. I decided to write about why I like these songs and express how my emotions twist and turn while listening to them. I really love diving in and hearing what the songwriter is trying to say. Sometimes the beat is what sucks me in, how it is really slow and patient or how it twangs along to its own rhythm. My dad always talks about vipassana where your mind is blank. That is something that is really hard for me, I am constantly moving or thinking and I just don’t have an off switch. When listening to music I feel calm, even if I am listening intently to the lyrics I can block everything else out except for the music. My dad has a stool that he does his meditation on, however mine is portable. I can bring music wherever I go and slip into that mindset easily. Music has a power over me that I enjoy. It makes me feel nostalgic, happy, loved, sad, and most importantly it reminds me that it is okay to feel. I made this website to share how it makes me feel, and how it can make others feel that way if they open up and let music take over.
